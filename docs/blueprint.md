## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vivid sky blue (#4DB6AC), reminiscent of open skies and shared resources, evokes a sense of trust and community. 
- Background color: A light, airy off-white (#F0F8FF), nearly the same hue as the primary, creates a spacious feel, and prioritizes readability and visual comfort.
- Accent color: A warm amber (#FFB300) as a contrasting color that suggests value, capturing user attention for crucial UI elements without overwhelming the calm color scheme.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif, will be used for headlines.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a sans-serif, will be paired with Playfair to ensure legibility.
- Use clean, modern icons, with the amber accent color for key interactive elements.
- Emphasize white space to create a clean and modern layout. Use clear visual hierarchy.
